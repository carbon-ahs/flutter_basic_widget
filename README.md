A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

# Key points

• Three main categories of widgets are: structure and navigation; displaying
information; and, positioning widgets.

• There are two main visual design systems available in Flutter, Material and
Cupertino. They help you build apps that look native on Android and iOS,
respectively.

• Using the Material theme, you can build quite varied user interface elements to
give your app a custom look and feel.

• It’s generally a good idea to establish a common theme object for your app, giving
you a single source of truth for your app’s style.

• The Scaffold widget implements all your basic visual layout structure needs.

• The Container widget can be used to group other widgets together.

• The Stack widget layers child widgets on top of each other.
